### Description
PWM click is a simple solution for controlling 16 PWM outputs through a single I2C interface. 
You can use it to control anything from a simple LED strip to a complex robot with a multitude of moving parts. 
The click boardâ„¢ carries the PCA9685PW IC. The board has an additional set of pins that allow you to connect 
up to seven PWM clicks together (using three jumpers to specify a different I2C address for each one). 
This will allow you to get a total of 112 pwm outputs on a single I2C line. 
PWM click is designed to use either a 3.3V or 5V power supply.
